# Install Your First Agent

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Now that you have used Dexto to build your own agent, let's explore some of the in-built agents that come with Dexto.

### 1. List available Agents

Dexto comes shipped with in-built agents for common use-cases. 

Use the `list-agents` command to list the in-built agents.

```bash
dexto list-agents
```

Here you will see many different agents — podcast agent, triage agent, database agent, etc.

Each agent is pre-configured with the right tools, prompts, and LLM settings for its domain. 

No setup required — just install and start using them.

### 2. Install a new agent

```bash
dexto install music-agent
```

This will install the music-agent with your preferred LLM you chose during setup, and you can immediately start running it!

```bash
dexto list-agents
```

This command will verify that the agent was installed successfully.

### 3. Run the installed agent

```bash
dexto --agent music-agent
```

With this command, you will now be talking to your newly installed music agent!

Use the `/tools` command to list its available tools in the CLI.

Also look at [Music Agent Demo and Tutorial](../tutorials/music-agent) for more details.

### 4. Uninstall the agent
```bash
dexto uninstall music-agent
```

This command uninstalls the agent.

```bash
dexto list-agents
```

Verify the agent was successfully uninstalled.

### 5. Reinstall it with in-built LLM settings

```bash
dexto install music-agent --no-inject-preferences
```

The first time when you installed `music-agent`, Dexto automatically injected your preferred LLM as the LLM to be used for this agent.

To avoid this and use the default LLM shipped for the music-agent, use the `--no-inject-preferences` argument while installing the agent.

This is preferable for certain agents that work better with pre-set LLMs, such as the nano-banana agent, which requires gemini.

Now let's rerun the list-agents command to see the installed agents.

```bash
dexto list-agents
```

You will now see that the music-agent has a different LLM configuration (the default one, as opposed to your preferred one)

In case you install an agent incorrectly, or want to use the default LLM config, you can always uninstall and reinstall agents.

### 6. Use the `dexto which` command to find the path to your agent file

```bash
dexto which music-agent
```

This command will show you the path to the installed music-agent so you can edit it directly if you are comfortable!


### 7. Update the music-agent to be your default agent

Open the dexto preferences file:

```bash
vi ~/.dexto/preferences.yml
```

Update the `defaultAgent` from `default-agent` to `music-agent`

Before:
```yml
defaults:
  defaultAgent: default-agent
```

After:

```yml
defaults:
  defaultAgent: music-agent
```

Now re-start dexto without any arguments

```bash
dexto
```

Ask it "Who are you?", and you will see that instead of the `default-agent`, dexto is now using the `music-agent`!

Similarly, if you want to change the default to any other agent, just update `defaultAgent` to any valid agent-name!

## Congratulations!
You've just installed your first pre-built AI agent with Dexto and set it as your default agent!

You've learned how to:

- ✅ List available agents in dexto with the `dexto list-agents` command
- ✅ Install agents with the `dexto install` command
- ✅ Uninstall agents with the `dexto uninstall` command
- ✅ Use the `--no-inject-preferences` argument with `dexto install` command to use default LLM preferences.
- ✅ Find the file path to installed agents with the `dexto which` command
- ✅ Set any agent as your preferred default agent in `dexto`

You are now ready to explore other in-built agents like the podcast agent, triage agent, database agent, and more!
